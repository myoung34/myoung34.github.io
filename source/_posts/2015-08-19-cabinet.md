I decided many months ago to build a bar-top cabinet. After many frustrations and failed attempts: it's done.<!-- more -->

It was fairly simple after getting the table saw I needed and some parts later on.
Basically it was a fly-by-your seat design with some generic parts.

 * Raspberry Pi running PiPlay
 * A super cheap [8" LCD with LVDS to HDMI/Composite out](https://www.panelook.com/EJ080NA-04C_Innolux_8.0_LCM_overview_12715.html)
 * Wood.
 * Arcade buttons and a USB controller for them.

After giving up and restarting a few times, lo' and behold.
