I made a Tilt Hydrometer data receiver on a T-PicoC3 microcontroller in go + python <!-- more -->

{% img /images/tpicoc3.gif %}
{% img /images/tpicoc3.png %}

This lets me send data from my tilt to (in my case) datadog via Zapier!

Lets dive in:

The tpicoc3 has 2 chips that can talk over UART. 

* A raspberry pi RP2040 that can read the buttons and write to the TFT
* An ESP32 that can do BLE/Wifi

So for this Im using micropython on the ESP32 to read BLE for iBeacons (tilts allowlisted), connect to wifi, send the data both over UART and HTTP POST.
The RP2040 will read on UART and display to the TFT.

You flash the different chips by USB-C polarity (flip the cable).

First we have to figure out which side is which. If you plug it in and run `dmesg` you'd see either something that says RP2040 or JTAG (ESP32).
Below is the `dmesg` output for ESP32

```
[ 1149.114007] usb 2-1.5: USB disconnect, device number 3
[ 1151.132877] usb 2-1.5: new full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci-pci

```

Lets erase this bad boy. You'll need to install [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) first.

```

Next lets grab the binary for the ESP32C3. That is (currently) [here](https://micropython.org/download/esp32c3-usb/)

`$ wget https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp32c3-usb-20220618-v1.19.1.bin`

Lets flash it:

```
➜  Downloads esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x0 esp32c3-usb-20220618-v1.19.1.bin

```

If you want to send the data via HTTP POST, grab that [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib/master/urequests/urequests/__init__.py)

`$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib/master/urequests/urequests/__init__.py`

Load up [thonny](https://thonny.org/) and flash it. Make sure you jump IO9 to GND (one time cost).
In Thonny load up [this code](https://github.com/myoung34/bluey-lite/blob/main/main.py)

Make sure to modify the HTTP post information (or remove it altogether) as well as the wifi info

Hit save, choose the microcontroller and youre done here.


Next: the other side. Flip your USB c cable.
Now hold the Boot button, press Run, let go of boot. The screen will go black and you should see a new drive show up named `RPI-RP2`

Lets flash it.

You'll need [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/) and [go](https://golang.com) set up. If you dont: then just drop the (asuming you trust me, but the RP2040 cant use wifi or anything anyway) binary from [here](https://github.com/myoung34/bluey-lite/releases)

Drop it into that `RPI-RP2` drive and unmount it.

Bam. Done.
