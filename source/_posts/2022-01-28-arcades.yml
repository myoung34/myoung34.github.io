I spent a good chunk of 2021 rebuilding arcades for people <!-- more -->

<br/>
<br/>
If you're going to send me hate letters for pandoras box: go ahead and hit the back button. I made these for people who dont want a bunch of arcades, so every single one of these was pandoras box.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll share some before and afters:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An atari centipede (already JAMMA) in mostly good condition. <br/>
* Turned into Pandoras box<br/>
* The CRT was bad, they wanted it LCD<br/>
* They wanted to just turn the marquee blank<br/>
* The 6 button wiring harness was a joke<br/>
* I wanted to keep the steel control board so I welded back all the button holes and redrilled and added some nice polylaminate artwork over it<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A knock off galaga<br/>
* Turned into Pandoras box<br/>
* The control panel was hacked together on 3/4" MDF<br/>
* A real fire hazard internally<br/>
* CRT was bad, but the glass was good. The "marquee" was just paint on the backside: easily removed with acetone<br/>
* Wood was mostly saveable minus the water soaked edges/corners. Fixed with lots of sanding and bondo.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A Stern Berzerk in absolute terrible condition<br/>
* Turned into Pandoras box<br/>
* This took 90% of the time just to sand.<br/>
* All the wood is pressed wood that had started to come apart at the bottom. Had to cut it all off and fix with bondo<br/>
* Custom cut a new control panel from 3/4" MDF<br/>
* The CRT was bad, replaced with a monitor inlaid into a new 3/4" MDF with a router for the bezel cover<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Knock off WWE Wrestlefest turned Survival Arts<br/>
* Rewired to CHAMMA, added pandoras box<br/>
* CRT was still in great shape, no glass and didnt have the ability to cut plexi. Sold at a yard sale<br/>
* CPO was hacked together with plexi over it. Cut all new 3/4" for the 6 buttons, kept the hardware + plexi<br/>
* Repainted, 3d printed a "MAME" marquee and glued to a new marquee<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Zaxxon hacked into a poker game<br/>
* Disgusting estate sale find. <br/>
* Contained dead rat<br/>
* CRT was saveable with some magnet work<br/>
* Recut new CPO from 3/4" MDF and wired to CHAMMA with pandoras box<br/>
* Kept all artwork and 90s style fake wood laminate<br/>
* 3d printed a cover for the front hole (not pictured)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Completely empty MK2 shell<br/>
* Stole CPO from another similar Midway shell<br/>
* Customer wanted light up LEDs which required hacking up all the button PCBs to separate the ground and voltage and wiring them to the +5V on the CHAMMA harness<br/>
* New LCD built into shell from a 32" TV<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Gem fighter<br/>
* A dynamo cabinet turned into gem fighter<br/>
* They wanted mrs pacman marquee and a generic multi-game CPO - a nice polylaminate one with zelda, donkey kong, pacman etc<br/>
* Wood was originally in great shape, CRT was bad. Said fixable but needed a complete overhaul. Used an LCD to replace.<br/>
* Paint touch up, replacement locks<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Custom 4 Player from MK1 cabinet<br/>
* MK1 cabinet modified to fit a 4 player CPO<br/>
* Built dimensions to fit, using custom latching system to remove (does not fit through a standard door as-is)<br/>
* 2 Players are to CHAMMA harness as usual, the other 2 players are USB into pandoras box. Worked surprisingly easy<br/>
* Wanted it galaga themed, so galaga marquee and side artwork ordered to fit<br/>
* Original 25" CRT still worked great, added plexi<br/>
