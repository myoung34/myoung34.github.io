<p>This took about a year, off and on. With covid I finally found some time to finish it.</p>

<h3>Build Hardware</h3>

<ul>
<li>Base was customized heavily by me from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2436848">this one</a>. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4186032">Mine here</a> supports less ugly wrist pads IMO, printed in Wood PLA from hatchbox on a taz6 at 0.1micron height</li>

</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I ran into a lot of issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>With the feather I had to swap <code>GPIOA</code> and <code>GPIOB</code> for <code>EXPANDER_COL_REGISTER</code> and <code>EXPANDER_ROW_REGISTER</code></li>
<li>It took <em>months</em> for me to realize that the Serial stuff with <code>SPLIT_KEYBOARD</code> <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/feature_split_keyboard">here</a> does <em>not</em> work with an IO expander like the MCP23018. This is poorly documented IMO. You have to use two of the same chipsets to use that feature and the feather 32u4 aint cheap</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/issues/57">this issue</a> would have been massively helpful originally to know I was wiring it incorrectly.</li>
<li>Swapping the board from the right side to the left side turned out massively tedious and <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9181/files#diff-6b1633df300bad911cd57febbbbdb2aaR63">my PR</a> suffers for it.</li>
<li>Im dumb and bought a mislabeled TRS cable as a TRRS cable and it obviously didn&rsquo;t work combined with my inability to count the rings on it.</li>

    <link href="https://marcyoung.us/post/atlantis-opa"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We really like Atlantis and smart pre-flight checks. <!-- more --></p>

<p>If you see a trend in my latest blogs it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll guess i really like <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org">OPA</a>.</p>

<p>We use it in EKS to report on assertions consistently across all our clusters.</p>

<p>I use it to run tests against the gatekeeper rules.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty awesome, and it <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/terraform">supports terraform plans</a>.</p>

<h3>The Set-Up</h3>

<p>I started off by forking the upstream atlantis AMI and baking the aws-cli into it.</p>

<p>In my atlantis.yaml I set up all the repos to use a new workflow <code>opa-workflow</code> such:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>workflows:
</span><span class='line'>  opa-workflow:
</span><span class='line'>    plan:
</span><span class='line'>      steps:
</span><span class='line'>        - init
</span><span class='line'>        - plan
</span><span class='line'>        - run: terraform$ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION workspace select -no-color $WORKSPACE
</span><span class='line'>        - run: terraform$ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION show -json $PLANFILE &gt;"${PROJECT_NAME}_${PULL_NUM}_$(git rev-parse HEAD).json"
</span><span class='line'>        - run: aws s3 cp "${DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}_${PULL_NUM}_$(git rev-parse HEAD).json" s3://bucket_name/terraform/tfplan/ &gt;/dev/null</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This pushes the plan file as <code>production_1234_somesha11122.json</code> into the bucket.</p>

<p>Next we have an AWS lambda with conftest built in. It responds to <code>terraform/tfplan/*.json</code> S3 create notifications, parses out the SHA, PR number, and workspace from atlantis, then runs:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>command:= exec.Command(
</span><span class='line'>  "/var/task/bin/conftest",
</span><span class='line'>  "test",
</span><span class='line'>  "--no-color",
</span><span class='line'>  "--output",
</span><span class='line'>  "json",
</span><span class='line'>  "/tmp/tfplan.json"
</span><span class='line'>)
</span><span class='line'>output, err := command.CombinedOutput()
</span><span class='line'>if err != nil {
</span><span class='line'>  fmt.Printf("[%s] conftest failed: %v", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"), err)
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this works, we can parse back the info to a comment and send a success|failure status to the git sha!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>if statusString == "failure" {
</span><span class='line'>  atlantisStatus := &github.RepoStatus{
</span><span class='line'>    State: github.String(statusString),
</span><span class='line'>    Description: github.String("TerrOPA Failures"),
</span><span class='line'>    Context: github.String("atlantis/plan"),
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>  client.Repositories.CreateStatus(backgroundctx, orgName, repoName, gitSha, atlantisStatus)
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few people ask me why I did it this way as an AWS lambda vs just running it on atlantis. I actually tried this first, but it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;clean&rdquo;.</p>

<p>First: if atlantis plan fails, its not very intuitive, <em>especially</em> if it&rsquo;s not a terraform error. It&rsquo;s kind of an unformatted stack trace.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/terropa2.png"></p>

<p>With that exception it&rsquo;s not very feedback friendly. The point of this project is to provide a clean feedback loop for those who may not know or care what OPA is. We have quite a few methods of automatically generating terraform projects from cookie cutter + modules. I wanted a way of providing as much context as possible.</p>

<p>Next: we have a fairly large engineering team and I like to work in a &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; modal. When I&rsquo;m introducing something new I like to be able to toggle it on and off quickly, or gather metrics before pushing for changes. In this way, it&rsquo;s completely separated from Atlantis and has its own SDLC, which is nice from a &ldquo;Marc, you broke everything&rdquo; perspective.</p>

<p>Lastly I had to make a call from a security perspective. The point of this is 100% to be able from an upper architectural/infosec level to make assertions. For example: tagging. Tagging for us is partially for billing, partially to see our accountability plane, but <em>mostly</em> so that we can scope least privilege.</p>

<p>Having this with atlantis would mean the policies live in the atlantis repo for the container builder - I dont want to bounce atlantis every time we add/change policies.</p>

<p>Otherwise it would mean the policies live with the terraform which means that you could modify the assertions per-branch which is also a choice we made to avoid. These policies are open for contribution from everyone but it&rsquo;s an explicit rule that it&rsquo;s not meant to be able to shifted per branch and introduce a threat model around modifying it to pass when it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

    <link href="https://marcyoung.us/post/smart-home"/>
    <updated>2020-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://marcyoung.us/post/smart-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quick write up of how I have IoT devices that I consider secure (at the cost of my sanity).  <!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last year figuring out what I want to control &ldquo;things&rdquo; in my house. And after wasting a bunch of time and money I finally have a set up I like.</p>

<h2>The Network</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any crazy networking gear, just a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/R7000-100PAS-Nighthawk-Parental-Controls-Compatible/dp/B00F0DD0I6">Netgear r7000</a> running <a href="https://www.myopenrouter.com/kong-downloads">Kong</a></p>

<p>Configuring this for my setup is painful, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Network (wired + wireless N+AG): I whitelist all my devices by Mac Address and assign static IP&rsquo;s to things.</li>
<li>Guest Network: no whitelisting, can only reach the internet</li>
<li>Black Hole Sun: My black hole wifi for things I don&rsquo;t trust like my TV. I know for a fact that the TV tries to send data over open wifi&rsquo;s so my hope here is to prevent that by giving it valid networking that just cant talk to anything at all.</li>
<li>Server network: My main server stuff is here. A nomad cluster across an i7 server and a bunch of pi&rsquo;s, also a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS918+">DS918+</a>. DNS is here because I use Consul with dnsmasq. Some smart stuff lives here like my <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/">ecobee</a>.</li>
<li>IoT Network: the real meat. This is nearly the same as the black hole one except it  can talk to the Server Network for C&amp;C (esphome)</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Software</h2>

<p>First I played with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io">tasmota</a> and the devices would randomly require me to set them up again.</p>

<p>Have you ever bought a device that turns on, sets up an AP for you to connect to then configure it? Thats a lot like Tasmota.</p>

<p>The problem is that in just a few days I had to set up the same devices multiple times. So I&rsquo;d go to do something, it wouldnt exist in homeassistant, and Id see a few <code>tasmota-#####</code> AP&rsquo;s I had to set up again.</p>

<p>I solved this by pulling the source code down, modify the configs (which took a lot of figuring out for the settings), compile it, flash it. Per device.</p>

<p>Then I had to upload the actual config for pins/buttons/etc. I hated this. Every second of it.</p>

<p>After playing around with <strong>way</strong> too many things, I finally landed on <a href="https://esphome.io/">esphome</a>.</p>

<p>Esphome is amazing. It has over-the-air updates, it automatically compiles based on some yaml and uploads it!
If it cant upload it (like the initial flash) I would simply set up the yaml, compile it, SCP it locally and flash it with <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">https://github.com/espressif/esptool</a>. If this worked, it would now support OTA updates.</p>

<p>Because its a bunch of yaml I can source control it too!</p>

<p>It uses passwords for both API integrations (home-assistant) and for OTA updates (same or different password) which makes me feel good.</p>

<p>Also: the server runs as a container, so its running on my Server network on nomad. I can simply go to <a href="http://esphome.service.consul">http://esphome.service.consul</a> and click &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; to update my IoT.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/esphome.png"></p>

<p>As for the controlling the devices I chose home-assistant. It has great support for ESPHome.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/hass.png"></p>

<h2>The Devices</h2>

<p>This is what you&rsquo;re really here for. Everything is ESP based for esphome.</p>

<p>I flashed almost all of these with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-FT232RL-Converter-Adapter-Breakout/dp/B00IJXZQ7C">ftdi serial adapter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">esptool.py</a> similar to</p>

<h3>Garage Door Opener</h3>

<p>This one took some learning to get right.
Its a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B081CSJV2V">nodemcu ESP8266</a> hooked up to a 12v relay shimmed to the garage door trigger. Triggering GPIO16 triggers the relay.
Attached to GPIO5 is a reed switch on the garage door track that is open or closed. The reed switch is a magnetic based switch. When a magnet is near it, it  breaks the switch (open) meaning the garage door is closed. I wired it this way so that the only way the door can be considered &ldquo;closed&rdquo; is that the magnet has broken the sensor. No power, messed up sensor, manually opened (without using the garage door chain) etc would all be considered an open door. I chose this because I&rsquo;d rather be safe than sorry and the door being closed is not an assumption but a fact.</p>

<h3>Sprinklers</h3>

<p>This one is in progress. It works but I haven&rsquo;t finished the housing (needs to be gasket based and ABS).</p>

<p>This is based on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Development-ESP8285-Wireless-Internet/dp/B07BK435ZW">wemos d1 mini</a> and is essentially 2 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010LT2GPG">12v solenoid valves</a> on GPIO16 and GPIO14. the 12V is controlled based on circuitry through diodes and TIP120 fed from a 12V source (dropped to 5v via a LM7805 to the d1 mini).</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>This one is still a bit in progress. My end goal is to take snapshots on an interval and push them to s3 so that I can play around with machine learning, but right now it lets me view it in hass (no recording as of now).</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RXPHYNM">esp32-cam</a> because it&rsquo;s very cheap. That&rsquo;s all, and it supports esphome.
The housing I 3d printed <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3652452">from here</a></p>

<p>Note: This was a bit annoying to set up the first time. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;just flash it&rdquo;, you need to set up <a href="https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs">spiffs</a> correctly. Which looked like this:</p>

<h3>LED Strips</h3>

<p>In the kids room I have some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twinkle-Star-Waterproof-Extendable-Decoration/dp/B07FSLWPRB">star lights</a>, and on our Pergola I have some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Waterproof-Christmas-Kitchen-Daylight/dp/B00HSF66JO">waterproof LED lights</a> all controlled with:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nexlux-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Included/dp/B07116SX41">This magic home smart controller</a> . I chose this because its ESP8266 based and flashable!</p>

<h3>Light Bulbs</h3>

<p>For the bulbs I chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RZ8QMG3">globe brand</a> because theyre also ESP8266 based.</p>

<p>For 2 of 3 of these I had success with <a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">tuya-convert</a> which was pleasant.
Basically I built my .bin from the yaml below, replaced tasmota.bin in that dir with it because I&rsquo;m sneaky, ran tuya-convert, flipped the light off/on 3 times and it flashed.</p>

<p>For 2 of them (1 I broke), I had to get down and dirty. I basically tore it apart and followed <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Mirabella-Genio-Bulb">this guide</a>. Temporarily soldering and removing all the heat safe gunk is not fun. But 1 flashed. 1&hellip;.caught fire&hellip;.</p>

<h3>Smart Plugs</h3>

<p>These come in handy for seasonal stuff like xmas lights, etc. But especially for my 3d printer as an emergency safe-measure (forget to turn off etc)</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonoff-Compatible-Assistant-Supporting-Required/dp/B07YXVWC3Y">Sonoff S31</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/s31_1.jpg">
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/s31_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Easy to take apart, a bit annoying to flash (involves temporarily soldering), but work amazingly.</p>

<p>The yaml makes sure that its on by default and that the power button is a hard toggle for the power for manual control. Blue light indicates wifi, red indicates on/off for the relay.</p>

<p>I kept blowing my outdoor smart bulb, I&rsquo;m guessing the voltage or current is too volatile?</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PCCT9">TreatLife single pole</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/ss01s.png"></p>

<p>This yaml lets the LED indicator (GPIO4) toggle with the virtual button (GPIO13) and the physical button (GPIO12)</p>

    <link href="https://marcyoung.us/post/gatekeeper-v3"/>
    <updated>2019-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Enforce allow/deny Policies in kubernetes at a base controller level  <!-- more --></p>

<p>I was at kubecon the in mid-November with an old roommate (in the same industry as me) and some coworkers but got to see some cool kubernetes stuff.</p>

<p>Since my job crosses the Security boundary, and I&rsquo;m fairly new to k8s, most of my talks were somewhere on the basic level or <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa">opa level</a>. With OPA what you get is a lightweight language to write policies your kubernetes cluster should adhere to.</p>

<p>Typically (I think) this is traditionally run by building your policies into a sidecar and forcing it to be an <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/kube-mgmt">admission controller</a>.</p>

<p>Gatekeeper simplifies this by removing the side-car for native CRD&rsquo;s and adds a few things like audit logs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to build up an example of this using EKS.</p>

<p>I assume we have a working EKS cluster:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ aws-vault exec home -- kubectl get all
</span><span class='line'>NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
</span><span class='line'>service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   172.20.0.1   &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP   6h15m</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before we deploy anything, let&rsquo;s set up GateKeeper v3:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ aws-vault exec home -- kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Gatekeeper should now be running (albeit with no policies):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ aws-vault exec home -- kubectl get all -n gatekeeper-system
</span><span class='line'>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span class='line'>pod/gatekeeper-controller-manager-0   1/1     Running   1          144m
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>service/gatekeeper-controller-manager-service   ClusterIP   172.20.41.90   &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP   144m
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>NAME                                             READY   AGE
</span><span class='line'>statefulset.apps/gatekeeper-controller-manager   1/1     144m</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, before we move on, I&rsquo;m going to set up <a href="https://github.com/garethr/policykit">policykit</a> so that we can use real REGO (the language for OPA) instead of rego embedded inside yaml (allows policy testing etc later on):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ pip install policykit

</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>EOF</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What we have now is a rego file that will validate base images (parameterized). Let&rsquo;s write some tests.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s generate our ConstraintTemplate (the basic template that accepts parameters):</p>

<p>As you can see that rego is now embedded inside a ConstraintTemplate yaml. Let&rsquo;s apply it:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Introducing a modular arcade kegerator  <!-- more --></p>

<h3>The Backstory</h3>

<p>I recenly got into doing random stuff with arcades.
In October 2018 I got ahold of a completely ripped apart San Fransisco Rush cabinet.
I redid some of the wood, built a computer into it, reversed all the controls into a teensy and made it play Rocket League.
My tattoo shop is currently painting it (build log to come when I have it back).</p>

<p>In trade, I&rsquo;m fixing their arcade machine.</p>

<p>So now apparently I like real arcade machines <a href="https://marcyoung.us/post/mame-cabinet/">and not my now-broken table top</a>.</p>

<p>I also brew beer. Why not combine the two?!</p>

<p>So I introduce to you:</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/barcade1.jpg">

<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/barcade2.gif">
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/marquee.gif"></p>

<h3>The Hardware</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Marquee is a custom &ldquo;vintage style neon light&rdquo; from a company on alibaba.</li>
<li>The Computer is a <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1727.html?search=lattepanda%20alpha&amp;description=true">lattepanda alpha</a></li>
<li>The LED Buttons are <a href="https://groovygamegear.com/webstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=408">spectra eclipse</a></li>
<li>The LED controller is an <a href="https://www.arcaderenovations.com/ultimarc-pacled64.html">Ultimarc pacled64</a></li>
<li>The Cabinet was custom cut on a CNC</li>
<li>The &ldquo;split&rdquo; frame is based on <a href="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-ecrovlce13/images/stencil/500x659/products/10801/13177/pygcjgwqewky6od7qomr__54105.1563214651.png?c=2">this style of aluminum tongue/receiver</a> from TCH hardware</li>
<li>The &ldquo;latches&rdquo; and the handles for the split top are from TCH Hardware</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Software</h3>

<p>The lattepanda runs Ubuntu with MAME. I originally chose windows, but LEDBlinky is <em>awful</em>. Just awful.
So instead I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/ledspicer/wiki/Home/">LEDSpicer by Patricio Rossi</a>. The software worked nearly out of the box and he&rsquo;s been super helpful for getting me up and running.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hacking &ldquo;aviary&rdquo; scooters for fun.  <!-- more --></p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/scooters.jpg" title="scooters" ></p>

<p>I recently came across some neglected and forgotten &ldquo;Aviary&rdquo; scooters and wanted to see what could be done.</p>

<h2>Segway ES2/4</h2>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/es4.jpg" title="es4" ></p>

<p>This was the easiest hack I&rsquo;ve ever done. Remove the top panel with security bits, and replace the board with one from ebay similar <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/EUUAAOSwH2Vb7453/s-l300.jpg">to this</a></p>

<p>Plug it in and go. Done.
Cost: ~$40</p>

<h2>Xiaomi Mijia M365</h2>

<p>This one was much more fun.</p>

<p><img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_1.jpg" title="m365" >
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_2.jpg" title="m365" >
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_3.jpg" title="m365" >
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_4.jpg" title="m365" >
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_5.png" title="m365" >
<img src="https://marcyoung.us/images/m365_6.jpg" title="m365" ></p>

<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p>This one was easy. Apparently the Xiaomi Mijia m365 is very commonly hacked already. They&rsquo;re extremely popular overseas, and people have already dedicated their time to reverse engineering the firmware. So much so that you can just use a <a href="https://m365.botox.bz/">webpage to change the settings and download a binary file to upload</a>.</p>

<p>Just download your bin file there, upload <a href="https://m365.botox.bz/static/com.m365downgrade-v7_PATCHED.apk?q=1531494897">with the android app</a> connect to your scooter and go.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>

<p>This one was also slightly trivial.</p>

<p>First thing I did was 3D printed one of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3064321">these bad boys</a>.</p>

<p>Then I ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dorhea-Display-3-3V-5V-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B07FK8GB8T">0.96&#8221; screen (4 pin i2C <em>not</em> 7 pin SPI)</a></p>

<p>Next you&rsquo;ll need an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Atmega32U4-Bootloadered-Development-Microcontroller/dp/B01MTU9GOB">arduino micro pro</a> and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-FT232RL-Converter-Adapter-Breakout/dp/B00IJXZQ7C">FTD1232 flasher</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/100-Pieces-1N4148-Switching-High-Speed/dp/B079KJ91JZ">diode</a>.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/augisbud/m365_dashboard">this code</a> flash the arduino, wire it according to his guides below.</p>

<p>Note: I modified the <a href="https://github.com/augisbud/m365_dashboard/blob/master/M365/language.h">locale files with some maths</a> along with other tweaks I&rsquo;m not publishing to do miles instead of kilometers, change the intro logo and colors.</p>

<p>Cover it using any m365 button cover via ebay.</p>

<p>Done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I one-upped my own bad idea with more badness. Don&rsquo;t do this.  <!-- more --></p>

<p>I, uh. Yeah.</p>

<p>I assume you <a href="https://marcyoung.us/post/deploy-production-button">read my previous post about my physical deploy button</a>. Well: I one-upped it.</p>

<p>Let me explain. Nah let&rsquo;s cut to it. I wanted to play with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/">AWS IoT</a> and I did so shamelessly with much architecture.</p>

<h3>The architecture</h3>

<p>I had a spare Raspberry Pi Zero W with a camera. So I did what any reasonable person would do. Used it with no end-goal.</p>

<p>I hooked it up to AWS IoT and made it <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/using-device-shadows.html">listen to the shadow delta MQTT queue</a></p>

<p>Basically whenever it saw a change to the shadow it would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spin a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stepper-Bipolar-4-lead-Connector-Printer/dp/B00PNEQKC0">stepper motor</a> that landed a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Avengers-Gamma-Grip-Fists/dp/B072QMZTZ4">hulk hand</a> on my deploy production button.</li>
<li>Thanks to py3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html">threads</a> it would also start the rasp pi camera to watch the hulk smash and send it to <a href="https://www.giphy.com">giphy</a>.</li>
<li>After the gif is done uploading it would send a gif of the hulk smash back to the user in slack.</li>
</ol>


<h3>The finale</h3>

<p>Without further ado I give you: Hulk Smash Production.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://giphy.com/embed/xuW89v9kQXMeQ">initial gif</a></p>

<p>And the final gif (yes the hulk hand is duct taped to a bamboo skewer to a stepper motor):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a physical button to deploy production and regret nothing.  <!-- more --></p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been looking for a project.</p>

<p>I currently work for a python shop and have really taken a liking to it. Simultaneously, I keep seeing new hardware <a href="https://micropython.org">supporting micropython</a>. I&rsquo;m not against the C&#8217;ish language that the arduino type stuff pushes for, but it&rsquo;s nice to get the best of both worlds: an abstracted language with nice syntax and the ability to do dumb stuff with voltage. So: I did just that.</p>

<h3>The Controller</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve really wanted to play with the ESP8266 after seeing some cool projects cross over my feeds. I decided also to kill two birds with one stone and try the Huzzah board <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821">from adafruit</a> that includes onboard wifi because I hate money. The board itself was fantastic out of the box.</p>

<h3>The Learning Curve</h3>

<p>Without doing any whatsoever much research my brain really thought that micropython was going to be a &ldquo;drop in replacement&rdquo; for the UX of programming a board in the arduino IDE. It&rsquo;s not. This is actually my biggest complaint about micropython. The code itself was very very very straightforward. Write a <code>main.py</code> that does your stuff, and profit. You can load libraries that support micropython, etc.</p>

<p>Getting there? Meh.</p>

<p>First: you have to flash your esp with <a href="https://micropython.org/download">the micropython firmware</a>.</p>

<p>Next: you have to get your code onto the board. The feedback loop for this is the annoying part. The first time you flash the firmware you have to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-esp8266-webrepl/access-webrepl">enable WebREPL</a>. It&rsquo;s a one-time cost but it&rsquo;s smelly. This enables a wifi broadcast from the board that you can then access from webrepl with a password.</p>

<p>If you make it past the previous step you can make <code>main.py</code> join your wireless network (note: 5ghz is not supported) with something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>import network
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>def do_connect():
</span><span class='line'>    if not sta_if.isconnected():
</span><span class='line'>        print('connecting to network...')
</span><span class='line'>        sta_if.active(True)
</span><span class='line'>        sta_if.connect('The LAN Before Time', 'hunter2')
</span><span class='line'>        while not sta_if.isconnected():
</span><span class='line'>            print('waiting to connect...')
</span><span class='line'>            sleep(5)
</span><span class='line'>            pass
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>print('connecting...')
</span><span class='line'>do_connect()
</span><span class='line'>print('network config:', sta_if.ifconfig())</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that it&rsquo;s on the network you can use webrepl to the local address of the huzzah. But it still sucks compared to the typical UX of: select board, click compile.</p>

<h3>What You Came To See</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still reading I&rsquo;m sure you want to see what I did. Basically I took 4 mechanical keyboard switches (I have a lot OK?!), wired them to the huzzah, and made it send a slack command to our internal slack bot to <em>force</em> deploy production (ignore all locks, send a message to yours truly).</p>

<h2>Background: a rant</h2>

<p>Let me start off by saying: I&rsquo;ve done <em>a lot</em> of Jenkins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exhibit A (super old jenkins with fake pipelines): <img class="right" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/jenkins-old.png" title="jenkins 1.4" ></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve done new Jenkins (I love 2.0 and love Jenkinsfile&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with <a href="https://jenkins.ovirt.org">large jenkins installs</a>.
I&rsquo;ve worked with small jenkins at multiple shops.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve automated backups with S3 tarballs:</p>

</span><span class='line'>aws s3 cp $filename s3://$backup_bucket/backups/$backup_name</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;ve automated backups with <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/thinBackup">thin backup</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve automated creating jobs with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin">job-dsl</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve automated creating jobs with straight XML.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve automated creating jobs with <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/">jenkins job builder</a>.</p>

<p>They all suck. I&rsquo;m sorry. But they&rsquo;re complex and require a lot of orchestration and customization to work.</p>

<h2>Im gonna do worse</h2>

<p>My problem with all these previous methods is they require a hybrid suck. You have to automate the jobs and mix that with retaining your backups.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m tired of things using the filesystem as a database.</em></p>

<p>These things are complex because the data lives in the same place as the jobs. When you build up your jobs they contain metadata about build history. So you end up with these nasty complicated methods of pulling down and merging the filesystem.</p>

<p>My hypothesis: #(@$ that. Lets use a real database and artifact store for the data and just not care. Crazy Right?!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins">got some demo code</a> to prove to you how easy it is. It&rsquo;s 100% groovy. No job dsl, no nothing. Just groovy and java methods.
The one I posted shows how I automated groovy to set up:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/ad.groovy">Active directory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/ecs.groovy">AWS ECS agents</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/github.groovy">Github organizations (includes webhooks!)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/slack.groovy">Slack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins.properties">Libraries like better slack messages and jobs defined in a java properties file</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/logstash.groovy">Logstash for the real meat of this post</a></li>
</ol>


<h2>The real reason youre here</h2>

<p>My jenkins master is docker. Its volatile. And its stateless.</p>

<p>So how do I do it? In production my docker hosts listen to UDP port 555 with Logstash for syslog and forward them to ELK (because SSL, and other reasons).
<a href="https://github.com/myoung34/docker-jenkins/blob/master/jenkins/logstash.groovy">In my example the logstash plugin just sends directly to elasticsearch</a>.
All the env vars are pulled from <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io">vault</a> at run time and I get to manage the data like my other data from ELK.</p>

<p>My artifacts go to someting like <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory">artifactory</a>.</p>

<p>And guess what? It&rsquo;s fantastic. Automation is dead simple. And I put the data in a real database. which lets me do things like see build times across projects, see deployments, etc.</p>

<h2>Terraforming the certificate issuer</h2>

<p>If you somehow get the previous part to run, it will fail because you have to create the role in Vault before you can just start generating certs off it. In the <a href="https://cuddletech.com/?p=959">cuddletech guide</a> this is under <code>Requesting a Certificate for a Web Server</code> as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ vault write cuddletech_ops/roles/web_server \

</span><span class='line'>Success! Data written to: cuddletech_ops/roles/web_server</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But what if I told you, you could do that in terraform?</p>

<p>If you add that with your ECS task along with the vault role and policy from the previous post about Vault Anything in Terraform, all your dependencies are met and kept in code!</p>

<p>You can now generate certificates off your PKI backend and grab secrets all in one go!</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
<li>Vault running as a server</li>
<li>Vault CLI to match the server</li>
</ol>


<h2>Create the Root cert/key</h2>

<p>(This is actually mostly a clone from <a href="https://cuddletech.com/?p=959">here</a> but I want to make sure it never disappears)</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: You should not let the vault server generate the root CA, you should generate it and import it. I just havent figured out how to do that yet. I will update this post when I get around to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offline_root_certificate_authority">More info on that here</a></p>

<li>Mount the PKI backend for the root</li>

    <id>https://marcyoung.us/post/vault-anything-in-terraform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now we get to the fun part and put everything we need from Vault in terraform. <!-- more --></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used ECS and Vault with the <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html">aws auth backend</a> you may have found a bit of a snag in terms of automation.</p>

<p>Lets say you want to create a new ECS container to run. You want that task to get specific secrets in vault by role. You write the code, terraform, etc and when it runs you get:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>URL: GET https://server:8200/v1/auth/aws-ec2/role/somerole
</span><span class='line'>Code: 400. Errors:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>* entry for role somerole not found</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So you deployed something but now you have to create a policy, a role, etc in vault via the CLI, all the while your task is throttling.</p>

<p>Little known fact: the terribly-named <code>vault_generic_secret</code> from the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/index.html">provider docs</a> can do create roles/policies in addition to secrets (hence the bad name).</p>

<p>In this part 2 I&rsquo;ll show you how to automate the next step of your ECS task into terraform so there&rsquo;s no race condition.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
<li>Vault running as a server</li>
<li>Vault CLI to match the server</li>
<li>Terraform</li>

    <id>https://marcyoung.us/post/reinvent-2017</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was my worst overall conference experience to date. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Along with many others, I had my share of complaints, but this one takes the cake.</p>

<p>This conference had an estimated 43,000 people. It was yuge. And it was actually well-run. Everything &ldquo;ran&rdquo; smoothly overall, but the experiences varied wildly from person to person. I&rsquo;ll sum mine up:</p>

<ol>
<li>I registered for talks only 2-3 days after it opened. I was &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; for 3. All others for 6 days were walk up only.</li>
<li>We were told to get to walk ups at least 30min early. The rooms were guaranteed 80% reserved with 20% for walk ups. I was at multiple over an hour early at 3 and sat outside and worked, no big deal. I was in the 20% buffer each time, confirmed by the person counting the line. At all 3 I was turned away within 15 people of the door for &ldquo;fire code&rdquo;. So the math: An hour sitting, turned away. The next talk is in 30 min, so that&rsquo;s a no go. So waste 30 minutes or and spend an hour waiting at next one to get in. Turned away there as well, with nothing to do for the next 30min. That&rsquo;s 3 hours of sitting.</li>
<li>Each full room has &lsquo;overflow&rsquo;. One was great, it was a big auditorium with bluetooth headsets and limited capacity, which I was able to get into. The others were a big shared room using a special WiFi hotspot to listen in on an app you download to your phone. It was oversaturated by all of the overflow so it kept cutting out. That happened twice.</li>
<li>The main talks were spread across 3-4 hotels, the main ones being MGM Grand and the Venetian, which are not near each other. So you walk or take the provided buses. The buses are great, but they didnt travel the strip and took about 20 minutes to make the 1.5 mile distance. Next: all of the buses load and unload at the same spot. So you end up waiting an extra 15-20min in a busline waiting for the other multiple buses to  unload then fully (or partially) load back. So ~45minutes for a 1.5mile ride.</li>
</ol>


<p>So after 6 days I got to see 3 talks. I asked for a refund and was given the approval, but was told that &ldquo;a few thousand people are having similar complaints. management is already looking at how to improve the 2018 version based on feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notable annoyances on the trip not related to amazon but added to the overall experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>The MGM grand was full and I obviously got the &lsquo;under construction&rsquo; room. There was no placard (number) so it was hard to find (especially if drinking). The entertainment center was completely busted with wood that fell when I tried to use it. The wall safe was closed/locked and management could not get it to open, so I couldn&rsquo;t use it for my cash. My keycards didnt work, and it&rsquo;s on the other side of the hotel from the lobby (~10min walk). When it&rsquo;s late: walk 10 min to the room. Cards dont work. Walk 10 min to lobby to get new one. Walk 10 min back to get into room. This happened 4 times to the point where they  waived all of my fees and changed the lock on day 4 to an upgraded RFID version (so kudos there).</li>
<li>American airlines keeps changing my name to Marcus AMERICANAIRLINES Young. TSA precheck checks against your full name so I have to get it printed at counter (waiting in that line negates the bonus of having TSA precheck). They couldnt get it to go through even after confirming my KTN and said &ldquo;all they can do is keep printing my ticket to see if it gets TSA&rdquo;. So after spending an hour to not get that to work I just go through the normal line (why did I pay for TSA precheck?)</li>
</ol>


<p>I used up my entire conference budget for re:Invent. Never again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another ergonomic mouse review I gone and did <!-- more --></p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been on an ergo kick (no pain, just realized how much more efficient I am).</p>

<p>I reached out to a company selling a product much like the ContourMouse ergo mice but at a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ergoslider-Plus-Ergonomic-Roller-Bar-Tendinitis/dp/B071JNSD9Z/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507601165&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ergoslider">much lower price</a>.</p>

<p>My assumption was that it would be ergo&#8217;ish but clunky. I was wrong. This thing is great!</p>

<p>The first thing I realized, and drove me crazy for a few minutes, is that the roller bar is not attached. The documents don&rsquo;t say much, so I first thought I was missing a part. It says it&rsquo;s detached, but it didnt make sense to my brain. So after finding nothing in the booklet I just dropped it in its place and it was working. Strange. The contourmouse ones have it on a metal bar, this doenst pretend that. If you&rsquo;ve cleaned a contourmouse bar, its pretty awful. Requires bending metal, etc. This thing is cool, just remove it and rub it down with an alcohol wipe, done. I did wish it locked into place somehow though, because the drive to work involved it getting wedged under something in my backpack.</p>

<p>In terms of usage, this thing is very much what I expected, plus some. Its very fluid, feels solid, and works great. The OS (mac + windows) worked immediately with it and didn&rsquo;t require pulling any software/drivers down.</p>

<p>After using it for about 30 days now, I can say that if you&rsquo;re looking for an ergo mouse at a small price, look no further. This has been my go-to and will likely stay that way. It&rsquo;s been at our &ldquo;standing desk&rdquo; area for about two weeks and has prompted quite a few questions and quite a bit of usage.</p>

<p>My only cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The detachable mouse is both a pro and a con. It&rsquo;s great because it&rsquo;s detachable, but it&rsquo;s not because it&rsquo;s detached. It&rsquo;s not actually detachable, because it&rsquo;s literally always loose. Can probably get lost easily.</li>
<li>The drivers are non-customizable. You can&rsquo;t map the buttons  to anything else, they are what they say they are. The biggest plus to contour mouse is that the keys are 100% mappable through software.</li>
</ol>


<p>The pros:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pretty much anything you can imagine about an ergo mouse: comfort, quality, usage, ease.</li>
</ol>


<p>Overall: buy this if you want to save a bit of cash.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve Recently been really into ergonomic mice, and wanted to give my thoughts on a few after going all in. <!-- more --></p>

<p>In the last few months, I&rsquo;ve been pretty into mechanical keyboards and form factor. I&rsquo;ve been using an original (very old) Rollermouse for about 2 years now and was looking to upgrade it (the thing is huge).</p>

<p>My current home setup is a Contour Rollermouse free2 and a pok3r (Cherry MX Clears) and a Logitech G700s for gaming.

<p>My work set up is a TechKeys JD40 on a 1up case (80g Cherry MX browns) and a Contour Rollermouse Red.
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/red1.jpg"></p>

<p>While shopping around, I came upon the <a href="https://amzn.to/2tguHYQ">Penclic NiceTouch t2</a>. It caught my eye because it&rsquo;s <em>exactly</em> the same size as my pok3r. The original contourmouse is hilariously larger than my keyboard, so that&rsquo;s a huge draw.
They sent me one to sample, so I decided to do a pro/con of my setups.</p>

<h2>Contourmouse Red</h2>

<p>This is by far the most sturdy of all of the mice. It&rsquo;s made of stainless steel, and could be used as a bludgeon. It doesnt move, and the rollerbar at the top is very thick with a grippy surface area to it.
My biggest complaint with the original contourmouse was that you ran out of horizontal space. You&rsquo;d have to hold it far left to let the mouse slowly track over, or right because there was no physical space for the mouse to go left or right anymore.
I got adjusted to it but it happened often enough to notice. With the red, this is gone. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s smarter or if the acceleration takes care of it, but it never happens, or just happens far less.</p>

<p>All the buttons are 100% programmable in OSX/Windows via their driver. I havent tried on linux, but I&rsquo;m sure it is. The bar itself has a physical tensioner as well which is nice to add resistance. And as far as usability: it&rsquo;s great. The roller bar
is a physical left click if you press, and everything is in the right place. I dont have to move my hands <em>at all</em> to use it.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/red1.jpg">
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/red2.jpg"></p>

<p>The drawback is price. It&rsquo;s crazy expensive, and I got lucky to find it on ebay after months of searching/bidding for a low price. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth the original MSRP, but I love it.</p>

<h2>Contourmouse Free2</h2>

<p>This one has most of the same pros as the Red, but I find myself getting annoyed at the physical bar occasionally. It&rsquo;s smaller than the red in terms of diameter, it&rsquo;s closer to the original contourmouse. It makes it a little harder to get your thumb on
and move freely just because it&rsquo;s thinner. The tensioner isnt that great, so sometimes after a long coding session when my hands get a little stiff the mouse shows my thumb shakiness a little on &ldquo;exact&rdquo; clicks like on small buttons. That&rsquo;s when I can tell
I&rsquo;ve been at it too long. And the original complaint about physical left/right exists here. I find myself out of space to go left or right and have to break focus to move the mouse over. If I were trying to do exact work like CAD/3d modelling I&rsquo;d probably
throw it out the window by this point. It&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s not worth the price considering how much nicer the Red is. Also, after only a few weeks, the palm rest started coming apart, and I used a sticker to prevent it from spreading. I can tell you right
now though, the sticker is functionally part of it now. If I pull it off, the padding will come with it. They  call the pads replaceable, but that assumes you can find it. I can&rsquo;t find replacement pads that dont come with a full keyboard.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/free1.jpg">
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/free2.jpg"></p>

<p>This one is not worth the price, but I&rsquo;d buy it again if it were &lt; $60.</p>

<h2>Penclic NiceTouce T2</h2>

<p>This is the one I was iffy about. Functionally, it&rsquo;s great. They sent me the matching keyboard, the Penclic NiceTouch C2, which is a chiclet key style keyboard. Together they work fine. If you like chiclets it types and works great.
However, my biggest problem is not with the keyboard, but with the trackpad. As a trackpad, it&rsquo;s fine, but it doesn&rsquo;t support gestures or multi-finger. I&rsquo;ve become so used to being able to do two-finger scroll that it&rsquo;s frustrating to not have it.
There is a physical rotating key that lets you scroll left right, but the right side of my palm kept touching it and making my cursor jump in vim.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/t2_1.jpg">
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/t2_4.jpg">
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/t2_5.jpg">
<img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/t2_6.jpg"></p>

<p>My other complaint is with the buttons. They&rsquo;re not labeled or programmable so you <em>have</em> to read the booklet to know what buttons &frac34; do. They&rsquo;re also impossible to reach. The draw to the contourmouse design is that the bar clicks but also those buttons
are very reachable by your thumbs. You can put your hands on the Home keys and not  have to move your hands at all to be efficient. With the T2 the buttons are so far down that they&rsquo;re not reachable, meaning I have to move my hands to click them. At that
point I&rsquo;d rather have a mouse. Without two-finger scroll it means that I cant do anything except move my mouse up/down/left/right without moving my hands around.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://marcyoung.us/images/t2_3.jpg"></p>

<p>The only other complaint I have is that if you use the trackpad with a different keyboard (like my pok3r), it&rsquo;s too low and leave a huge gap vertically. There are no risers (like on most keyboard) to raise the trackpad, so I stuffed a piece of cardboard
under it, but that made it a bit wobbly. I could probably 3d print something, but that&rsquo;s pretty intense for an out-of-the-box experience. Lastly, the trackpad is <em>very</em> light. So light that it moves around while using it.  It probably only weighs a few
ounces which gives it a flemsy breakable feel. Having something that light on top of a  piece of cardboard created a very unstable setup.</p>

    <link href="https://marcyoung.us/post/bless-part2"/>
    <updated>2017-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part 2 of deploying Bless will focus on enforcing MFA and using Lyft’s client. <!-- more --></p>

<p>The problem at this point is that anyone in the ops group can bounce without MFA enforced. We can set up the lyft client, which enforces MFA, but if we dont make other changes, there’s no enforcement of MFA. ie you can still call the netflix client and bounce right in.</p>

<p>The other issue is that Netflix’s bless holds true the idea of a bastion host. In-house, we have IPSec tunnels from our VPC’s to our internal network, so I dont need to bounce through a bastion. So I want anyone to be able to bounce, given that they have permissions (ops) and they used MFA. Lyft’s doesn’t enforce the bastion concept, which is nice.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>In the IAM console in AWS, enable an MFA device for your user.</p>

<h2>Setting up the client</h2>

<p>I wrote a wrapper to simplify this. Feel free to not like it, but I put this in my <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> to make it easier:</p>

<p>Nice! But again, MFA is used, not enforced. Lets change that.</p>

<p>What did we do? We basically said ops users can assume the bless-client role or call kms:Encrypt on that key, but only if they used MFA. If you try the original bless client now, it will fail.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>Time and terraform. I like terraform because I dislike cloudformation. Feel free to adapt.</p>

<h2>Installing Bless</h2>

<p>This is actually the easiest part, because it’s straight forward. Side note: I like bless because of its simplicity. It uses lambda + KMS and nothing more. The permissions are stupid simple. The purpose, after talking to one of the guys behind it, was to make it feel native and un-intrusive. It works.</p>

<h2>Setup Config</h2>

<p>This was the hardest to get going, because configuration always is. The readme says to paste in a function to lambda to generate your password. But thats not needed with the super awesome lambda container from <a href="https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda">lambci</a>. To do this, create a file function.py with the contents:</p>

<h1>Deploy</h1>

<h2>IAM</h2>

<p>The first piece is the IAM portion for Bless. I need to allow it to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate random keys from KMS (obvious)</li>
<li>Decrypt the KMS key that’s the password for Bless. This is generated and</li>
<li>Create the log group (maybe not necesary since Lambda does that for you?)</li>
<li>Push logs</li>
</ol>

<h1>Test</h1>

<p>You should now have a lambda that can generate certificates to use. You’ll need to put the public keys from <code>foo1.pub</code> and <code>foo2.pub</code> into your servers at <code>/etc/ssh/cas.pub</code> and add <code>TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/cas.pub</code> to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> You can test this with their client:</p>
