    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently set up paperless-ngx and wanted an easy way to simply email myself receipts or documents and get them uploaded and tagged. <!-- more --></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/">paperless-ngx</a> is a super cool way to host docs. I wanted originally to just organize and digitize my receipts and taxes in a way that will stay backed up and easy to find.</p>

<p>Then I realized I want to simplify it because that process can take a long time manually.</p>

<p>First: I set up mailgun for my tld, lets say <code>mail.foo.com</code>
Mailgun has a free tier thats more than enough for my low volume use-case, and they allow you to forward messages after filters to a webhook.</p>

<p>I created a route that checks that I sent it and forwards it to something I deployed (will go over that futher below) behind a tailscale funnel (so that it can be exposed to the wider net).</p>

<p>Next I wrote a super minimal flask app called <a href="https://github.com/myoung34/mailgun-to-paperless-ngx">mailgun-to-paperless-ngx</a> that will take the attachments from mailgun and upload them to paperless-ngx using the <code>To</code> as tags. Example: <code>receipt+work@mail.foo.com</code> with an attachment <code>dinner.jpg</code> will upload it to paperless as <code>dinner</code> (title) and tags <code>receipt</code> and <code>work</code>.</p>

<p>Lets see it by sending this image out to <code>testing@mail.foo.com</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/gmail.png"></p>

<p>We see mailgun posted it.</p>

<p>We also now see that the flask app is processing and uploading it:</p>

<pre><code>file saved to /tmp/dinner.jpg
Uploading dinner.jpg to http://paperless-ngx.paperless-ngx.svc.cluster.local:8000 with tags [20]
Upload complete. Task ID: d8148db1-19a2-4392-8e3b-17f16fc905ef
Checking on task d8148db1-19a2-4392-8e3b-17f16fc905ef ...
waiting for task d8148db1-19a2-4392-8e3b-17f16fc905ef to complete...
Checking on task d8148db1-19a2-4392-8e3b-17f16fc905ef ...
task d8148db1-19a2-4392-8e3b-17f16fc905ef completed successfully
</code></pre>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s in paperless as expected</p>
