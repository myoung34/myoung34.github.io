    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quick write up of how I have IoT devices that I consider secure (at the cost of my sanity).  <!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last year figuring out what I want to control &ldquo;things&rdquo; in my house. And after wasting a bunch of time and money I finally have a set up I like.</p>

<h2>The Network</h2>

<p><del>I don&rsquo;t have any crazy networking gear, just a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/R7000-100PAS-Nighthawk-Parental-Controls-Compatible/dp/B00F0DD0I6">Netgear r7000</a> running <a href="https://www.myopenrouter.com/kong-downloads">Kong</a></del></p>

<p>I now have a very different set up.
<img src="/images/router.jpg"></p>

<p>Configuring this for my setup is painful, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Network (wired + wireless N+AG): I whitelist all my devices by Mac Address and assign static IP&rsquo;s to things.</li>
<li>Guest Network: no whitelisting, can only reach the internet</li>
<li>Black Hole Sun: My black hole wifi for things I don&rsquo;t trust like my TV. I know for a fact that the TV tries to send data over open wifi&rsquo;s so my hope here is to prevent that by giving it valid networking that just cant talk to anything at all.</li>
<li>Server network: My main server stuff is here. A nomad cluster across an i7 server and a bunch of pi&rsquo;s, also a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS918+">DS918+</a>. DNS is here because I use Consul with dnsmasq. Some smart stuff lives here like my <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/">ecobee</a>.</li>
<li>IoT Network: the real meat. This is nearly the same as the black hole one except it  can talk to the Server Network for C&amp;C (esphome)</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Software</h2>

<p>First I played with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io">tasmota</a> and the devices would randomly require me to set them up again.</p>

<p>Have you ever bought a device that turns on, sets up an AP for you to connect to then configure it? Thats a lot like Tasmota.</p>

<p>The problem is that in just a few days I had to set up the same devices multiple times. So I&rsquo;d go to do something, it wouldnt exist in homeassistant, and Id see a few <code>tasmota-#####</code> AP&rsquo;s I had to set up again.</p>

<p>I solved this by pulling the source code down, modify the configs (which took a lot of figuring out for the settings), compile it, flash it. Per device.</p>

<p>Then I had to upload the actual config for pins/buttons/etc. I hated this. Every second of it.</p>

<p>After playing around with <strong>way</strong> too many things, I finally landed on <a href="https://esphome.io/">esphome</a>.</p>

<p>Esphome is amazing. It has over-the-air updates, it automatically compiles based on some yaml and uploads it!
If it cant upload it (like the initial flash) I would simply set up the yaml, compile it, SCP it locally and flash it with <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">https://github.com/espressif/esptool</a>. If this worked, it would now support OTA updates.</p>

<p>Because its a bunch of yaml I can source control it too!</p>

<p>It uses passwords for both API integrations (home-assistant) and for OTA updates (same or different password) which makes me feel good.</p>

<p>Also: the server runs as a container, so its running on my Server network on nomad. I can simply go to <a href="http://esphome.service.consul">http://esphome.service.consul</a> and click &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; to update my IoT.</p>

<p><img src="/images/esphome.png"></p>

<p>As for the controlling the devices I chose home-assistant. It has great support for ESPHome.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hass.png"></p>

<h2>The Devices</h2>

<p>This is what you&rsquo;re really here for. Everything is ESP based for esphome.</p>

<p>I flashed almost all of these with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-FT232RL-Converter-Adapter-Breakout/dp/B00IJXZQ7C">ftdi serial adapter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">esptool.py</a> similar to</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
firmware="something.bin"
port="/dev/cu.usbserial-00000000"
esptool.py --port ${port} --baud 115200 erase_flash
esptool.py --port ${port} --baud 115200 write_flash 0x0 ${firmware}
</code></pre>

<h3>Garage Door Opener</h3>

<p>This one took some learning to get right.
Its a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B081CSJV2V">nodemcu ESP8266</a> hooked up to a 12v relay shimmed to the garage door trigger. Triggering GPIO16 triggers the relay.
Attached to GPIO5 is a reed switch on the garage door track that is open or closed. The reed switch is a magnetic based switch. When a magnet is near it, it  breaks the switch (open) meaning the garage door is closed. I wired it this way so that the only way the door can be considered &ldquo;closed&rdquo; is that the magnet has broken the sensor. No power, messed up sensor, manually opened (without using the garage door chain) etc would all be considered an open door. I chose this because I&rsquo;d rather be safe than sorry and the door being closed is not an assumption but a fact.</p>

<h3>Sprinklers</h3>

<p>This one is in progress. It works but I haven&rsquo;t finished the housing (needs to be gasket based and ABS).</p>

<p>This is based on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Development-ESP8285-Wireless-Internet/dp/B07BK435ZW">wemos d1 mini</a> and is essentially 2 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010LT2GPG">12v solenoid valves</a> on GPIO16 and GPIO14. the 12V is controlled based on circuitry through diodes and TIP120 fed from a 12V source (dropped to 5v via a LM7805 to the d1 mini).</p>

  - platform: gpio

    pin: 14
    inverted: no
</code></pre>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>This one is still a bit in progress. My end goal is to take snapshots on an interval and push them to s3 so that I can play around with machine learning, but right now it lets me view it in hass (no recording as of now).</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RXPHYNM">esp32-cam</a> because it&rsquo;s very cheap. That&rsquo;s all, and it supports esphome.
The housing I 3d printed <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3652452">from here</a></p>

<p>Note: This was a bit annoying to set up the first time. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;just flash it&rdquo;, you need to set up <a href="https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs">spiffs</a> correctly. Which looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>firmware="something.bin"
port="/dev/cu.usbserial-00000000"
# minimal spiffs:
esptool.py --port ${port} --baud 921600 --chip esp32 erase_flash

</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h3>LED Strips</h3>

<p>In the kids room I have some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twinkle-Star-Waterproof-Extendable-Decoration/dp/B07FSLWPRB">star lights</a>, and on our Pergola I have some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Waterproof-Christmas-Kitchen-Daylight/dp/B00HSF66JO">waterproof LED lights</a> all controlled with:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nexlux-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Included/dp/B07116SX41">This magic home smart controller</a> . I chose this because its ESP8266 based and flashable!</p>

<p><img src="/images/magichome.jpg"></p>

<p>Wiring that up to the FTDI I flashed this yaml:</p>

<pre><code>esphome:
  name: liam_room_starlights
  platform: ESP8266
  board: esp01_1m
wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_name

    cold_white: output_component4
    cold_white_color_temperature: 6536 K
    warm_white: output_component5
    warm_white_color_temperature: 2000 K

output:
  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: output_component1
    pin: 5

  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: output_component2
    pin: 12

  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: output_component3
    pin: 13

  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: output_component4
    pin: 15

  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: output_component5
    pin: 16
</code></pre>

<h3>Light Bulbs</h3>

<p>For the bulbs I chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RZ8QMG3">globe brand</a> because theyre also ESP8266 based.</p>

<p>For 2 of 3 of these I had success with <a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">tuya-convert</a> which was pleasant.
Basically I built my .bin from the yaml below, replaced tasmota.bin in that dir with it because I&rsquo;m sneaky, ran tuya-convert, flipped the light off/on 3 times and it flashed.</p>

<p>For 2 of them (1 I broke), I had to get down and dirty. I basically tore it apart and followed <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Mirabella-Genio-Bulb">this guide</a>. Temporarily soldering and removing all the heat safe gunk is not fun. But 1 flashed. 1&hellip;.caught fire&hellip;.</p>

</code></pre>

<h3>Smart Plugs</h3>

<p>These come in handy for seasonal stuff like xmas lights, etc. But especially for my 3d printer as an emergency safe-measure (forget to turn off etc)</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonoff-Compatible-Assistant-Supporting-Required/dp/B07YXVWC3Y">Sonoff S31</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/s31_1.jpg">
<img src="/images/s31_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Easy to take apart, a bit annoying to flash (involves temporarily soldering), but work amazingly.</p>

<p>The yaml makes sure that its on by default and that the power button is a hard toggle for the power for manual control. Blue light indicates wifi, red indicates on/off for the relay.</p>

</code></pre>

<h3>Smart Switch</h3>

<p>I kept blowing my outdoor smart bulb, I&rsquo;m guessing the voltage or current is too volatile?</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PCCT9">TreatLife single pole</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ss01s.png"></p>

<p>This yaml lets the LED indicator (GPIO4) toggle with the virtual button (GPIO13) and the physical button (GPIO12)</p>

<pre><code>esphome:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I one-upped my own bad idea with more badness. Don&rsquo;t do this.  <!-- more --></p>

<p>I, uh. Yeah.</p>

<p>I assume you <a href="/post/deploy-production-button">read my previous post about my physical deploy button</a>. Well: I one-upped it.</p>

<p>Let me explain. Nah let&rsquo;s cut to it. I wanted to play with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/">AWS IoT</a> and I did so shamelessly with much architecture.</p>

<h3>The architecture</h3>

<p>I had a spare Raspberry Pi Zero W with a camera. So I did what any reasonable person would do. Used it with no end-goal.</p>

<p>I hooked it up to AWS IoT and made it <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/using-device-shadows.html">listen to the shadow delta MQTT queue</a></p>

<p>Basically whenever it saw a change to the shadow it would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spin a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stepper-Bipolar-4-lead-Connector-Printer/dp/B00PNEQKC0">stepper motor</a> that landed a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Avengers-Gamma-Grip-Fists/dp/B072QMZTZ4">hulk hand</a> on my deploy production button.</li>
<li>Thanks to py3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html">threads</a> it would also start the rasp pi camera to watch the hulk smash and send it to <a href="https://www.giphy.com">giphy</a>.</li>
<li>After the gif is done uploading it would send a gif of the hulk smash back to the user in slack.</li>
</ol>


<h3>The finale</h3>

<p>Without further ado I give you: Hulk Smash Production.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hulksmash.png" title="hulksmash" ></p>

<p>The <a href="https://giphy.com/embed/xuW89v9kQXMeQ">initial gif</a></p>

<p>And the final gif (yes the hulk hand is duct taped to a bamboo skewer to a stepper motor):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a physical button to deploy production and regret nothing.  <!-- more --></p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been looking for a project.</p>

<p>I currently work for a python shop and have really taken a liking to it. Simultaneously, I keep seeing new hardware <a href="https://micropython.org">supporting micropython</a>. I&rsquo;m not against the C&#8217;ish language that the arduino type stuff pushes for, but it&rsquo;s nice to get the best of both worlds: an abstracted language with nice syntax and the ability to do dumb stuff with voltage. So: I did just that.</p>

<h3>The Controller</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve really wanted to play with the ESP8266 after seeing some cool projects cross over my feeds. I decided also to kill two birds with one stone and try the Huzzah board <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821">from adafruit</a> that includes onboard wifi because I hate money. The board itself was fantastic out of the box.</p>

<h3>The Learning Curve</h3>

<p>Without doing any whatsoever much research my brain really thought that micropython was going to be a &ldquo;drop in replacement&rdquo; for the UX of programming a board in the arduino IDE. It&rsquo;s not. This is actually my biggest complaint about micropython. The code itself was very very very straightforward. Write a <code>main.py</code> that does your stuff, and profit. You can load libraries that support micropython, etc.</p>

<p>Getting there? Meh.</p>

<p>First: you have to flash your esp with <a href="https://micropython.org/download">the micropython firmware</a>.</p>

<p>Next: you have to get your code onto the board. The feedback loop for this is the annoying part. The first time you flash the firmware you have to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-esp8266-webrepl/access-webrepl">enable WebREPL</a>. It&rsquo;s a one-time cost but it&rsquo;s smelly. This enables a wifi broadcast from the board that you can then access from webrepl with a password.</p>

<p>If you make it past the previous step you can make <code>main.py</code> join your wireless network (note: 5ghz is not supported) with something like:</p>

<pre><code>import network

sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)

def do_connect():
    if not sta_if.isconnected():

<p>Now that it&rsquo;s on the network you can use webrepl to the local address of the huzzah. But it still sucks compared to the typical UX of: select board, click compile.</p>

<h3>What You Came To See</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still reading I&rsquo;m sure you want to see what I did. Basically I took 4 mechanical keyboard switches (I have a lot OK?!), wired them to the huzzah, and made it send a slack command to our internal slack bot to <em>force</em> deploy production (ignore all locks, send a message to yours truly).</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    buttons = [
        machine.Pin(4,  machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP),
        machine.Pin(5,  machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP),
        machine.Pin(2,  machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP),
        machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP),
    ]

    _sum = 0
    for button in buttons:
        _sum += button.value()
    if (_sum == 0):
        print('generating request')
        print(urequests.post(webhook_url, json={'text': ":alert: DEPLOY BUTTON PRESSED. KLAXON: ACTIVATED :alert:"}, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}).status_code)
        print(urequests.post(webhook_url, json={'text': "!deploy prod master -f"}, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}).status_code)
</code></pre>

<p>It works and it&rsquo;s pretty empowering to smash. We deployed to production a record number of times that day.</p>
