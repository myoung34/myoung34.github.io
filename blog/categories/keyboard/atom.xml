    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent far too much time making a bluetooth dactyl keyboard with built in wrist rests <!-- more --></p>

<p>This took about a year, off and on. With covid I finally found some time to finish it.</p>

<h3>Build Hardware</h3>

<ul>
<li>Base was customized heavily by me from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2436848">this one</a>. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4186032">Mine here</a> supports less ugly wrist pads IMO, printed in Wood PLA from hatchbox on a taz6 at 0.1micron height</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771">Feather 32u4</a></li>
<li>TRRS cable</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology/MCP23018-E-SP">MCP 23018 io expander</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DF83HK7">Wrist rests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-oblotzky-gmk-oblivion-v2-custom-keycap-set?mode=guest_open">GMK Oblotzky Oblivion V2 caps</a></li>

<li><a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1613">1N4148 diodes</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I ran into a lot of issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>With the feather I had to swap <code>GPIOA</code> and <code>GPIOB</code> for <code>EXPANDER_COL_REGISTER</code> and <code>EXPANDER_ROW_REGISTER</code></li>
<li>It took <em>months</em> for me to realize that the Serial stuff with <code>SPLIT_KEYBOARD</code> <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/feature_split_keyboard">here</a> does <em>not</em> work with an IO expander like the MCP23018. This is poorly documented IMO. You have to use two of the same chipsets to use that feature and the feather 32u4 aint cheap</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/issues/57">this issue</a> would have been massively helpful originally to know I was wiring it incorrectly.</li>
<li>Swapping the board from the right side to the left side turned out massively tedious and <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9181/files#diff-6b1633df300bad911cd57febbbbdb2aaR63">my PR</a> suffers for it.</li>
<li>Im dumb and bought a mislabeled TRS cable as a TRRS cable and it obviously didn&rsquo;t work combined with my inability to count the rings on it.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a super tedious keyboard.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I’ve owned a Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate for about 3 years now. It was mostly to get into keyboards and try out a nice mechanical one. I still love it, but after getting more interested in them, I decided to build a planck.</p>

<p>A planck is basically an ortholinear keyboard (meaning the keys are in perfect columns and rows) and has 47-48 keys (4x12 called a 40%).</p>

<p>Basically your fingers do the work and your thumbs toggle the keyboard to differently layers.</p>

<p>I 3d printed the case, then wired up the columns and rows using 1N4148 diodes to a teensy. My first iteration used what looked like a really awesome 3d printed base, but it ended up overwhelming me because the wires had to be routed through very very tiny spaces, and my soldering iron: a) needed some love and b) kept melting the 3d printed base (because of all the tight spots). I then printed a much different and standard base and things went smoother.</p>

<p>I also got overwhelmed with the <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard">TMK firmware</a>. Everyone says it’s easy, and you’d think as a programmer I’d have some ease with it, but it’s super confusing and talks about bit shifting like it’s just adding numbers and you should be able to do it in your sleep. Then I found <a href="https://kb.sized.io/">this site</a> and was done in under an hour. Obligatory pictures.</p>
