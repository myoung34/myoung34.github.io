    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I currently own a ViewSonic GTablet, which I do love the few times I use it, but if you&#8217;re like me, you <del datetime="2012-11-27T04:17:03+00:00">tamper</del> break things you own.<!--more--></p>

<p>My GTablet runs <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1084573" title="Beasty Clemsysn (Froyo)"></a> which I prefer since it&#8217;s freaking fast, however with the performance, there are a few bugs, all of which I seemed to hit in a single move&#8230;.so this is a &#8220;Don&#8217;t do&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting it in airplane mode goes ape-shit. There was no way to get it out, including reboots and settings changes.</li>
<li>To fix this, I hit &#8216;Restore to factory defaults&#8217;&#8230; <strong>Don&#8217;t ever do this!</strong></li>
<li>This fubared everything, which means restore old Rom&#8230;yay for my free time tonight.</li>
</ul>


<p>So far, whatever&#8230;easy fix right?<br/>
Well if you&#8217;ve made it to this page, you see the title, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to fix.<br/>
If for some reason you&#8217;re trying to NVFlash your gtablet (probably with gtab.nvflash.1.2.branch.20110508 with cwm5504 or gtab.nvflash.1.2.branch.20110508 with cwmv3028.zip), and it&#8217;s freezing on the flash, here&#8217;s what I did.</p>

<p>Ready?<br/>
In the <em>gtablet.cfg</em> file, swap the partition in question (the one freezing) with the previous one, but swap it on the filesystem level.<br/>
For example, my Partition 7 froze on upload, so the diff between the original and my fix: <a href="https://gist.github.com/4152380" title="https://gist.github.com/4152380" target="_blank">gtablet.cfg-diff</a><br/>
If you want my full fixed file (assuming yours broke on partition 7 as well): <a href="https://gist.github.com/4152387" title="https://gist.github.com/4152387" target="_blank">gtablet.cfg/4152387</a></p>
