    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was my worst overall conference experience to date. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Along with many others, I had my share of complaints, but this one takes the cake.</p>

<p>This conference had an estimated 43,000 people. It was yuge. And it was actually well-run. Everything &ldquo;ran&rdquo; smoothly overall, but the experiences varied wildly from person to person. I&rsquo;ll sum mine up:</p>

<ol>
<li>I registered for talks only 2-3 days after it opened. I was &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; for 3. All others for 6 days were walk up only.</li>
<li>We were told to get to walk ups at least 30min early. The rooms were guaranteed 80% reserved with 20% for walk ups. I was at multiple over an hour early at 3 and sat outside and worked, no big deal. I was in the 20% buffer each time, confirmed by the person counting the line. At all 3 I was turned away within 15 people of the door for &ldquo;fire code&rdquo;. So the math: An hour sitting, turned away. The next talk is in 30 min, so that&rsquo;s a no go. So waste 30 minutes or and spend an hour waiting at next one to get in. Turned away there as well, with nothing to do for the next 30min. That&rsquo;s 3 hours of sitting.</li>
<li>Each full room has &lsquo;overflow&rsquo;. One was great, it was a big auditorium with bluetooth headsets and limited capacity, which I was able to get into. The others were a big shared room using a special WiFi hotspot to listen in on an app you download to your phone. It was oversaturated by all of the overflow so it kept cutting out. That happened twice.</li>
<li>The main talks were spread across 3-4 hotels, the main ones being MGM Grand and the Venetian, which are not near each other. So you walk or take the provided buses. The buses are great, but they didnt travel the strip and took about 20 minutes to make the 1.5 mile distance. Next: all of the buses load and unload at the same spot. So you end up waiting an extra 15-20min in a busline waiting for the other multiple buses to  unload then fully (or partially) load back. So ~45minutes for a 1.5mile ride.</li>
</ol>


<p>So after 6 days I got to see 3 talks. I asked for a refund and was given the approval, but was told that &ldquo;a few thousand people are having similar complaints. management is already looking at how to improve the 2018 version based on feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notable annoyances on the trip not related to amazon but added to the overall experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>The MGM grand was full and I obviously got the &lsquo;under construction&rsquo; room. There was no placard (number) so it was hard to find (especially if drinking). The entertainment center was completely busted with wood that fell when I tried to use it. The wall safe was closed/locked and management could not get it to open, so I couldn&rsquo;t use it for my cash. My keycards didnt work, and it&rsquo;s on the other side of the hotel from the lobby (~10min walk). When it&rsquo;s late: walk 10 min to the room. Cards dont work. Walk 10 min to lobby to get new one. Walk 10 min back to get into room. This happened 4 times to the point where they  waived all of my fees and changed the lock on day 4 to an upgraded RFID version (so kudos there).</li>
<li>American airlines keeps changing my name to Marcus AMERICANAIRLINES Young. TSA precheck checks against your full name so I have to get it printed at counter (waiting in that line negates the bonus of having TSA precheck). They couldnt get it to go through even after confirming my KTN and said &ldquo;all they can do is keep printing my ticket to see if it gets TSA&rdquo;. So after spending an hour to not get that to work I just go through the normal line (why did I pay for TSA precheck?)</li>
</ol>


<p>I used up my entire conference budget for re:Invent. Never again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I started playing around with Azure and deploying an ASP.NET MVC site via its Github linkage. I had some strange issues.<!-- more --></p>

<h1>Problem 1: I am a masochist</h1>

<p>Under the strange suspicion that I had no idea how to actually build NuGet packages and deploy an ASP.NET site via CI/CD I decided to take on the masochistic task upon myself.
If you <a href="https://github.com/myoung34/HelloWorldASP">take a look at my very basic MVC site</a>, you won&rsquo;t see much of interest. None actually, I&rsquo;m not sure why you possibly clicked that link.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a basic MVC app using a terrible NuGet package I&rsquo;ve been deploying that adds some string extension methods. If you run that in Visual Studio, all is well.</p>

<h1>Problem 2: The work proxy</h1>

<p>I tried to publish it to Azure using <a href="https://blogs.technet.com/b/cbernier/archive/2013/09/24/deploy-your-web-application-to-windows-azure-from-with-visual-studio.aspx">the publish feature from VS2013 into Azure</a> but immediately ran into a &lsquo;me&rsquo; problem.</p>

<p>You see, I was deploying from my work PC, which is absolutely blocked from doing anything. All of the traffic from my work PC <strong>must</strong> be published through a web proxy on-site.</p>

<p>This is fine for things like Chrome, which pick those settings up automatically. For cygwin (see problem 1) there are a lot of steps to take.</p>

<ul>
<li>wget/Vagrant: I had to export <code>http_proxy</code>, <code>https_proxy</code>, and <code>ftp_proxy</code> (after pulling down the proxy PAC and finding which proxy address to use).</li>
<li>cURL: I had to write a wrapper <code>/usr/local/bin/curl</code>(higher in the PATH) that basically said <code>/usr/bin/curl --proxy 'https://proxyaddress:80' "$@"</code>.</li>
<li>subversion: I had to add <code>http-proxy-host = proxyaddress</code> into <code>~/.subversion/servers</code> in the <code>[global]</code> section.</li>
<li>git: OMG GIT. So here&rsquo;s the thing. git behind a corporate firewall is hard. It can&rsquo;t resolve through DNS and it can&rsquo;t do anything it needs to do.

<ul>
<li>First I installed <a href="https://ntlmaps.sourceforge.net/">ntmlaps</a> into <code>~/software/ntlmaps</code></li>
<li>Next I set my <code>~.bash_profile</code> to start up a command in screen if it hasn&rsquo;t already to start ntlmaps.

<ul>
<li><code>[[ -n $(screen -ls | grep -E 'git-proxy.\*\((A|De)tached\)$') ]] || screen -d -S git-proxy -m python ~/software/ntlmaps/main.py</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next I set git to use this proxy: <code>for i in http https; do git config --global $i.proxy https://localhost:5865</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Problem 3: Visual Studio and Azure Deploy</h1>

<p><a href="https://blog.kloud.com.au/2014/11/13/publish-to-a-new-azure-website-from-behind-a-proxy/">Visual studio cannot deploy to Azure behind a PAC proxy</a>.</p>

<p>Sites like this one claim you can make changes to the VS2013 executable config but I had zero luck.</p>

<p>So little luck in fact that it just plain failed with an unconnectable error.</p>

<p>From then I said nevermind and decided to just link my Azure app to my github repo using the web UI. All went great and it immediately deployed however when I browsed to my website I was <a href="https://www.dotnetthoughts.net/azure-system-methodaccessexception-attempt-by-security-transparent-method/">greeted with this error.</a>.</p>

<p>All of the blog posts and stack overflow questions say to install the WebHelpers NuGet package via <code>Install-Package -Id  Microsoft.AspNet.WebHelpers</code>, but that didn&rsquo;t solve it. It redeployed and had the same error.</p>

<p>The posts also say to just select the <code>Remove additional files at destination</code> checkbox on Visual Studio deploy. Well that&rsquo;s useless because I cannot deploy via visual studio. After fighting long and hard and redeploying via Github repeatedly, I found the answer.</p>

<h1>Answer: Select the <code>Remove additional files at destination</code> no matter what.</h1>

<p>Yup. I changed to the guest network, selected the checkbox, published successfully and all went well. My app was now live.
I then pushed multiple changes/rebases into the github repo, and it&rsquo;s been working fine since.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since my last post, but I promise I have somewhat of a decent reason. I wrote a book on AWS design patterns!<!-- more --></p>

<p>About 4 months ago I was approached about writing a book on UDOO. I turned it down as I didn&rsquo;t feel like I would have enough content to write anything meaningful on it other than I have no idea what the name means. I then stayed on their list and reviewed a book on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-started-red-hat-enterprise-virtualization">RHEV</a> (or the downstream oVirt) as well as a book on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-puppet-security">puppet security</a>.</p>

<p>After doing these reviews I figured &ldquo;why not&rdquo; and asked if there were any topics I could work on. Long story short I wrote <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/implementing-cloud-design-patterns-aws">a book on implementing design patterns at AWS</a>.</p>

<p>Writing the book was fairly straight-forward and I didn&rsquo;t have too many issues. Basically I borrowed a lot of concepts from the very outdated topics from the Ninja Of Three pages (and by borrowed I mean don&rsquo;t go there) and adapted them for use, updated them to reflect changes at AWS (which get updated so much my book is already out of date before publication - hawt), and gave in depth information on what these patterns mean to DevOps, developers, and customers.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and <strong>really</strong> want to help a newbie out, please purchase it as 100% of the proceeds go to student loans and nice bourbon (order not guaranteed).</p>

<p>The book is pending a last review before publication right now. I submitted a few images for the cover photo that have not been selected by the publisher yet but I give you my top two rejected images.</p>
