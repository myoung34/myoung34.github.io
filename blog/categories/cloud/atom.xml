    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since my last post, but I promise I have somewhat of a decent reason. I wrote a book on AWS design patterns!<!-- more --></p>

<p>About 4 months ago I was approached about writing a book on UDOO. I turned it down as I didn&rsquo;t feel like I would have enough content to write anything meaningful on it other than I have no idea what the name means. I then stayed on their list and reviewed a book on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-started-red-hat-enterprise-virtualization">RHEV</a> (or the downstream oVirt) as well as a book on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-puppet-security">puppet security</a>.</p>

<p>After doing these reviews I figured &ldquo;why not&rdquo; and asked if there were any topics I could work on. Long story short I wrote <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/implementing-cloud-design-patterns-aws">a book on implementing design patterns at AWS</a>.</p>

<p>Writing the book was fairly straight-forward and I didn&rsquo;t have too many issues. Basically I borrowed a lot of concepts from the very outdated topics from the Ninja Of Three pages (and by borrowed I mean don&rsquo;t go there) and adapted them for use, updated them to reflect changes at AWS (which get updated so much my book is already out of date before publication - hawt), and gave in depth information on what these patterns mean to DevOps, developers, and customers.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and <strong>really</strong> want to help a newbie out, please purchase it as 100% of the proceeds go to student loans and nice bourbon (order not guaranteed).</p>

<p>The book is pending a last review before publication right now. I submitted a few images for the cover photo that have not been selected by the publisher yet but I give you my top two rejected images.</p>
