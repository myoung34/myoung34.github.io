<p>If you see a trend in my latest blogs it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll guess i really like <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org">OPA</a>.</p>

<p>We use it in EKS to report on assertions consistently across all our clusters.</p>

<p>I use it to run tests against the gatekeeper rules.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty awesome, and it <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/terraform">supports terraform plans</a>.</p>

<h3>The Set-Up</h3>

<p>I started off by forking the upstream atlantis AMI and baking the aws-cli into it.</p>

<p>In my atlantis.yaml I set up all the repos to use a new workflow <code>opa-workflow</code> such:</p>

<pre><code>workflows:
  opa-workflow:
    plan:
      steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: terraform$ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION workspace select -no-color $WORKSPACE
        - run: terraform$ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION show -json $PLANFILE &gt;"${PROJECT_NAME}_${PULL_NUM}_$(git rev-parse HEAD).json"
        - run: aws s3 cp "${DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}_${PULL_NUM}_$(git rev-parse HEAD).json" s3://bucket_name/terraform/tfplan/ &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>This pushes the plan file as <code>production_1234_somesha11122.json</code> into the bucket.</p>

<p>Next we have an AWS lambda with conftest built in. It responds to <code>terraform/tfplan/*.json</code> S3 create notifications, parses out the SHA, PR number, and workspace from atlantis, then runs:</p>

<pre><code>command:= exec.Command(
  "/var/task/bin/conftest",
  "test",
  "--no-color",
  "--output",
  "json",
  "/tmp/tfplan.json"
)
output, err := command.CombinedOutput()
if err != nil {
  fmt.Printf("[%s] conftest failed: %v", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"), err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once this works, we can parse back the info to a comment and send a success|failure status to the git sha!</p>

<pre><code>if statusString == "failure" {
  atlantisStatus := &amp;github.RepoStatus{
    State: github.String(statusString),
    Description: github.String("TerrOPA Failures"),
    Context: github.String("atlantis/plan"),
  }
  client.Repositories.CreateStatus(backgroundctx, orgName, repoName, gitSha, atlantisStatus)
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few people ask me why I did it this way as an AWS lambda vs just running it on atlantis. I actually tried this first, but it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;clean&rdquo;.</p>

<p>First: if atlantis plan fails, its not very intuitive, <em>especially</em> if it&rsquo;s not a terraform error. It&rsquo;s kind of an unformatted stack trace.</p>

<p><img src="/images/terropa2.png"></p>

<p>With that exception it&rsquo;s not very feedback friendly. The point of this project is to provide a clean feedback loop for those who may not know or care what OPA is. We have quite a few methods of automatically generating terraform projects from cookie cutter + modules. I wanted a way of providing as much context as possible.</p>

<p>Next: we have a fairly large engineering team and I like to work in a &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; modal. When I&rsquo;m introducing something new I like to be able to toggle it on and off quickly, or gather metrics before pushing for changes. In this way, it&rsquo;s completely separated from Atlantis and has its own SDLC, which is nice from a &ldquo;Marc, you broke everything&rdquo; perspective.</p>

<p>Lastly I had to make a call from a security perspective. The point of this is 100% to be able from an upper architectural/infosec level to make assertions. For example: tagging. Tagging for us is partially for billing, partially to see our accountability plane, but <em>mostly</em> so that we can scope least privilege.</p>

<p>Having this with atlantis would mean the policies live in the atlantis repo for the container builder - I dont want to bounce atlantis every time we add/change policies.</p>

<p>Otherwise it would mean the policies live with the terraform which means that you could modify the assertions per-branch which is also a choice we made to avoid. These policies are open for contribution from everyone but it&rsquo;s an explicit rule that it&rsquo;s not meant to be able to shifted per branch and introduce a threat model around modifying it to pass when it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
